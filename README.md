I am an academic worker and a PhD fellow, dedicated to agricultural economics, climate change, and sustainable development. My research interests are broad, and I am particularly interested in agri-product consumption, the COVID-19 shock on the economy, and hospitality management studies. I use applied microeconometric tools to build models and analyze data in my research.  I have a strong educational background, having earned both a double bachelor's degree in agricultural economics and political science and a double master's degree in statistics and agricultural economics from National Taiwan University.  Currently, my research is focused on developing a property price index for farmland in Taiwan. This involves addressing several challenges, including selection bias in transactions, spatial autocorrelation, and potential price factors that can distort the market. I hope that my work will provide insights into the farmland market in Taiwan that can inform policy decisions and improve economic outcomes.
